### Acknowledgements

-   The branding _StopperShop_ is just for styling purposes, I hold no affiliation or rights under this name. Iâ€™m simply too lazy to think of a more creative name, rather than ripping off a popular Indian franchise.
-   This project was made by following the brilliant tutorial by [Code With Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg).
-   This project is not completely optimized for mobile responsiveness.
